                    based out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely. 
                    They needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch their website</p>
                    <br>

                <p>the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test. According 
                    to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates 
                    questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. 
                    If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.</p>

                <p>In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what 
                    I’m working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper 
                    with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an 
                    issue and the sketches are just for me.</p>

                <p>I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen. 
                    For each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where 
                    they are in that particular flow and jump around as needed.” We’re 
                    digging this InVision-made wireframe.</p>
